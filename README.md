# Optimal-path-palnning-of-UAV-using-A-and-MEA-Algorithms
Implemented an efficient variation of Artificial Intelligence Algorithm (A*), named Memory Efficient Artificial Intelligence Algorithm (MEA*) to determine an optimal path in the varied obstacle regions for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) applications.
Tested both the Algorithms in 2D and 3D environments, using different modules names Python, Spyder and Matlab.
